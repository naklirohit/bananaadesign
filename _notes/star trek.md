**S06 E15: Tapestry**
Captain Picard gets the opportunity to change aspects of his life he was regretful about. Turns out they were also the formative events of his life. Like threads of a tapestry; if you "pulled out one of those threads, the whole tapestry would unravel".

**S06 E24: Second Chances**
Two Rikers, damn. Curious how this would play out in future.
