title: What is design
excerpt: Design is the practice of intuition with intent

As [Mike Monteiro](https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/mike-monteiro-111413434) says, 
> "Design is the solution to a problem with a set of constraints, and a designer is somebody who solves problems, given a set of constraints. That sounds so boring, but that's the job!"  

Victor Papanek called design,
>  "the conscious and intuitive effort to impose meaningful order"

I like to think of it as the *practice of intuition with intent.* 

Without intent, it's not meaningful. It will become an open-ended exploration without real impact on people or real contraints bounding the scope of solution. 

Designers build an intuition over time. Web designers has an eye for beautiful digital experience. Architect have intuition about the utilization of 3-dimensional space. Graphic designers about communicating ideas. Engineers have the intuition to design software. 

Intuition doesn't mean "not applying" the rules. It often means knowing the rules really well to not look them up; maybe even break them like an artist. 

Anybody who makes decisions in solving a problem is a designer. 

Designers have to be experts at what they do.
