title: 1:1s with your manager
excerpt: Things to go beyond status updates during 1:1s
---

As a manager, when I go into a 1:1 meeting, I'm often there to make sure my team member is successful. It gets difficult if I don't know what's stopping them from getting there. This post is a note to self, and advice for those who are starting their career.

1. **Own the agenda:** This is your time on the manager's calendar. It's also your job to decide what you want to discuss during that time. If most 1:1s go unplanned, the manager will eventually lose interest and stop taking these meetings seriously.

2. **Don't make it a status update:** 1:1s are not for status updates. They are a place to understand each other and make sure your goals align with the goals of you manager; and vice-versa. Most 1:1s are scheduled monthly, which is also an awefully long wait before you chose to share updates. Do them weekly or sooner.

3. **Talk about your growth:** 1:1s are good times to look for feedback on areas you can improve on. You can work with your managers to identify features or projects that will help you grow in a certain areas. When the right projects are around the corner, you'll be on their mind.

4. **Share what is troubling you:** Doesn't mean you should nag. However if you were not happy with a recent decision or the way things are going at work, your manager will be happy to hear your honest opinion about it.

5. **Ask your manager about their problems and how you can contribute:** Your manager is at a different tier of responsibility than yours. By asking and offering to help with those problems, you are a) getting exposed to a different facet of the business than you usually would, and b) getting practice dealing with things that will form the foundation of your next role.

6. **Take shared notes:** It's easy to forget a month old meeting, so take note of important things that are discussed. Try to end the 1:1 with clear action items for you and your manager. It ensures there is no miscommunication and offers a todo list before the next meeting. A shared Google Doc is probably the easiest way to maintain these.
