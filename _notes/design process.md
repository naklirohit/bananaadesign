title: Design process
excerpt: Encourage a collaborative process to make informed design decisions
---

[[Design]] is an act. As designers, we should encourage a collaborative process that includes people with different skills and helps them make informed decisions towards the end product. 

**Identify stakeholders who need to participate in the design of product**  
Don't forget to include the users in the design of your products.

**Understand the problem being solved**  
This is the part where you ask a lot of "why". Try to help all stakeholders understand the problem in depth, and why it's important to solve it. Try to learn about these things:
- Who is affected by the problem (aka *users*)
- How do they solve this problem today (aka *journey map*)
- What are the most inefficient parts of this current state (aka *opportunities* or *HMW* notes)
- What is the change our product will bring in their life (aka *outcomes*)

Things you can do:
- Run a workshop to identify opportunities and challenges. It can be very efficient to gather what interal stakeholders know about the problem. 
- Workshops are also good places to help stakeholders align on the most important opportunities. You can't solve every problem in your first release. 
- If a workshop is not possible, do stakeholder interviews to gather insights.
- Conduct secondary reserch to learn about users.
- Collaborate, organize, communicate.

**Solving the problem**  
Designers are expected to be good problem solvers. However not every problem is equal. Often, as designers, we may lack some skills to solve a problem effectively. This is when it's important to put our ego aside and bring people with the right skills.
- The solution doesn't need to be creative, it needs to work.
- Iterate early and often to learn what works and which idea to let go.
- Wireframes are efficient when you are not confident about the solution.
- Show prototypes to people in the company and watch their reactions.
