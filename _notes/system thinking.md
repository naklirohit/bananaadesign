title: System Thinking
excerpt: What good system thinking looks like

Based on notes from [this article](https://uxdesign.cc/every-design-is-a-system-28bb9bf028b7):

**Working atomically / Defining the basics.** This automates system-wide changes and avoids rework and unintended consequences.

**Making things reusable early and often**. Actively evaluate parts to optimize for reusability. Don't optimize too early. 

**Respecting the butterfly effects**. When designing a system, nothing happens in isolation. Something that feels like a small change in one place can amplify into massive revisions on the other end of your system.

**Oscillating between micro and macro vision.** Never lose sight of the wholeness and coherence of your system while you’re considering even the smallest details.

**Empowering yourself (or others) for exploration**. A system that’s too prescriptive will stifle creativity. Systems need to evolve organically over time. Defining a system means finding the balance between consistency and flexibility.

**Rationalising your decisions against the system.** If you can’t explain why your choice is the right one, it’s probably wrong!

**Documenting your system.** This can be a laborious task, but you need to document the decisions you make so they can understand the system you’ve created. If you work alone, that documentation still happens, but it may be all in your head — never externalised.
