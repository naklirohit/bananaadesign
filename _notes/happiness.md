title: Happiness is a systemic change
excerpt: The feeling of contribution provides happiness
---

We feel happy when we feel we are of use to someone. 

When we have low self-worth, we being to look for other ways to feel useful. We look for recognition. Everything we do becomes about getting recognized. This desire makes life a competition and we start seeing others as enemies. Our self-worth reduces further. It's a vicious cycle.

Alfred Adler said that all problems are interpersonal problems. The desire for recognition is an interpersonal problem too. It arises becase we can't separate our tasks from other people's tasks. Most unhappiness arises because we try to do other people's tasks or let them interfere in ours. 

When conducting the separation of tasks, we need to first ask ourselves the following question:
>Who ultimately is going to receive the end result brought about by the choice that is made? <cite>Alfred Adler</cite>

The way the other person acts or feels is their task.

High self-worth and seeing others as comrades reduces the need for recognition. 

We can, therefore, feel happy without needing others to recognize us.
