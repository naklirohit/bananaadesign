    <li>You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.</li>
    <li>Fall in love with the process rather than the product.</li>
    <li>The most powerful outcomes are delayed.</li>
    <li>The problem with goals is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.</li>
    <li>The problem is your system.</li>
    <li>Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe</li>
    <li>The problem is the direction of change.</li>
    <li>Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to improve.</li>
    <li>Once your pride gets involved , you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.</li>
    <li>Your self-image gets in the way.</li>
    <li>Continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.</li>
    <li>The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.</li>
    <li>Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.</li>
    <li>It is a simple two - step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.</li>
    <li>What do you want to stand for ? What are your principles and values ? Who do you wish to become?</li>
    <li>The focus should always be on becoming that type of person , not getting a particular outcome</li>
    <li>behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.</li>
    <li>Whenever you face a problem repeatedly , your brain begins to automate the process of solving it.</li>
    <li>Whenever the conditions are right , you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution.</li>
    <li>people who don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom.</li>
    <li>Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state.</li>
    <li>Your response also depends on your ability. It sounds simple , but a habit can occur only if you are capable of doing it.</li>
    <li>If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages , it will not become a habit.</li>
    <li>One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing.</li>
    <li>We need a “ point - and - call ” system for our personal lives.</li>
    <li>There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits.</li>
    <li>As you create your Habits Scorecard , there is no need to change anything at first. The goal is to simply notice
        what is actually going on.</li>
    <li>implementation intention is : “ When situation X arises , I will perform response Y. ”</li>
    <li>people who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow
        through
        .</li>
    <li>Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity.</li>
    <li>“ no more coordination , no more unity , no more beauty ” between his elegant robe and the rest of his stuff.
    </li>
    <li>Diderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions</li>
    <li>You often decide what to do next based on what you have just finished doing.</li>
    <li>One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack
        your
        new behavior on top.</li>
    <li>a small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do.</li>
    <li>filled with productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.</li>
    <li>alter the spaces where you live and work to increase your exposure to positive cues and reduce your exposure to
        negative ones.</li>
    <li>You can train yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context.</li>
    <li>Go to a new place — a different coffee shop , a bench in the park , a corner of your room you seldom use — and
        create a new routine there.</li>
    <li>Take a break from the space where you do your daily work , which is also linked to your current thought
        patterns.
    </li>
    <li>When you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment , redefine or rearrange your current one.</li>
    <li>“ One space , one use. ”</li>
    <li>avoid mixing the context of one habit with another.</li>
    <li>I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing , his tablet only for reading , and his phone only for
        social
        media</li>
    <li>When the context changed , so did the habit.</li>
    <li>Typically , 90 percent of heroin users become re - addicted once they return home from rehab.</li>
    <li>the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person , but by creating a more
        disciplined environment.</li>
    <li>Bad habits are autocatalytic :</li>
    <li>Watching television makes you feel sluggish , so you watch more television because you don’t have the energy to
        do
        anything else.</li>
    <li>It’s a downward spiral , a runaway train of bad habits.</li>
    <li>Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain , they are nearly impossible to remove
        entirely
    </li>
    <li>simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy.</li>
    <li>One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.</li>
    <li>leave your phone in another room for a few hours.</li>
    <li>If you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough , stop following social media accounts that trigger
        jealousy
        and envy.</li>
    <li>Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.</li>
    <li>Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues as supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightened
        version
        of reality</li>
    <li>Junk food , for example , drives our reward systems into a frenzy.</li>
    <li>the human brain has evolved to place a high value on salt , sugar , and fat.</li>
    <li>Entire departments are dedicated to optimizing how a product feels in your mouth — a quality known as
        orosensation
    </li>
    <li>Other processed foods enhance dynamic contrast ,</li>
    <li>They exaggerate features that are naturally attractive to us , and our instincts go wild as a result ,</li>
    <li>While it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus , we can make any habit more
        enticing
        .</li>
    <li>The ability to experience pleasure remained , but without dopamine , desire died. And without desire , action
        stopped.</li>
    <li>Every behavior that is highly habit - forming — taking drugs , eating junk food , playing video games , browsing
        social media — is associated with higher levels of dopamine.</li>
    <li>Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding , your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And
        whenever dopamine rises , so does your motivation to act.</li>
    <li>Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them. The wanting centers
        in
        the brain are large :</li>
    <li>allow Netflix to run only if he was cycling at a certain speed.</li>
    <li>Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do.</li>
    <li>“ In the long history of humankind , those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have
        prevailed
        . ” As a result , one of the deepest human desires is to belong.</li>
    <li>We don’t choose our earliest habits , we imitate them. We follow the script handed down by our friends and
        family
        ,</li>
    <li>In many ways , these social norms are the invisible rules that guide your behavior each day.</li>
    <li>We imitate the habits of three groups in particular : 2 The close. The many. The powerful.</li>
    <li>As a general rule , the closer we are to someone , the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits.</li>
    <li>One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired
        behavior
        is the normal behavior.</li>
    <li>If you are surrounded by fit people , you’re more likely to consider working out to be a common habit.</li>
    <li>Join a culture where ( 1 ) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and ( 2 ) you already have something in
        common with the group.</li>
    <li>one study found that when a chimpanzee learns an effective way to crack nuts open as a member of one group and
        then
        switches to a new group that uses a less effective strategy , it will avoid using the superior nut cracking
        method
        just to blend in with the rest of the chimps.</li>
    <li>Most days , we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.</li>
    <li>We try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves. Many of our daily habits
        are
        imitations of people we admire.</li>
    <li>We imitate people we envy.</li>
    <li>When our mother comes to visit , we clean up the house because we don’t want to be judged. We are continually
        wondering “ What will others think of me ? ” and altering our behavior based on the answer.</li>
    <li>If a behavior can get us approval , respect , and praise , we find it attractive.</li>
    <li>Look at nearly any product that is habit - forming and you’ll see that it does not create a new motivation , but
        rather latches onto the underlying motives of human nature.</li>
    <li>Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face ; they are just the methods
        you
        learned to use.</li>
    <li>Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to
        reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive.</li>
    <li>Instead of telling yourself “ I need to go run in the morning , ” say “ It’s time to build endurance and get
        fast.
        ”</li>
    <li>You can reframe “ I am nervous ” to “ I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate. ”
    </li>
    <li>“ My focus and concentration goes up just by putting my headphones [ on ] while writing. I don’t even have to
        play
        any music. ”</li>
    <li>If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write , that’s motion. If I actually sit down and write an
        article
        , that’s action</li>
    <li>the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action : you want to delay failure.</li>
    <li>Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really , you’re just preparing to get something done.
        When preparation becomes a form of procrastination , you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be
        planning. You want to be practicing.</li>
    <li>If you want to master a habit , the key is to start with repetition , not perfection.</li>
    <li>One of the most common questions I hear is , “ How long does it take to build a new habit ? ” But what people
        really
        should be asking is , “ How many does it take to form a new habit ? ”</li>
    <li>It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort , which states that when deciding between two similar
        options ,
        people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.</li>
    <li>We are motivated to do what is easy.</li>
    <li>the less energy a habit requires , the more likely it is to occur.</li>
    <li>In a sense , every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want. Dieting is an obstacle to getting
        fit
        .</li>
    <li>You don’t actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers.</li>
    <li>If you can make your good habits more convenient , you’ll be more likely to follow through on them.</li>
    <li>If you look at the most habit - forming products , you’ll notice that one of the things these goods and services
        do
        best is remove little bits of friction from your life. Meal delivery services reduce the friction of shopping
        for
        groceries. Dating apps reduce the friction of making social introductions.</li>
    <li>The purpose of resetting each room is not simply to clean up after the last action , but to prepare for the next
        action.</li>
    <li>“ How can we design a world where it’s easy to do what’s right ? ” Redesign your life so the actions that matter
        most are also the actions that are easiest to do.</li>
    <li>“ The ritual is not the stretching and weight training I put my body through each morning at the gym ; the
        ritual is
        the cab. The moment I tell the driver where to go I have completed the ritual.</li>
    <li>“ When you start a new habit , it should take less than two minutes to do. ” You’ll find that nearly any habit
        can
        be scaled down into a two - minute version : ■ “ Read before bed each night ” becomes “ Read one page. ”</li>
    <li>the point is not to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up.</li>
    <li>Commitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the right thing in the future by making bad habits difficult
        in
        the present.</li>
    <li>resident James Ritty , it was the first cash register. The machine automatically locked the cash and receipts
        inside after each transaction. Patterson bought two for fifty dollars each. Employee theft at his store vanished
        overnight.</li>
    <li>The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do.</li>
    <li>The brilliance of the cash register was that it automated ethical behavior by making stealing practically
        impossible
        .</li>
    <li>Each habit that we hand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next stage
        of
        growth.</li>
    <li>“ Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them. ”</li>
    <li>. We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings
        of
        pleasure — even minor ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well — are signals
        that
        tell the brain : “ This feels good. Do this again , next time. ”</li>
    <li>the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change : What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided.</li>
    <li>the neocortex — the newest part of the brain and the region responsible for higher functions like language — was
        roughly the same size two hundred thousand years ago as today. You are walking around with the same hardware as
        your Paleolithic ancestors.</li>
    <li>our ancestors spent their days responding to grave threats , securing the next meal , and taking shelter from a
        storm. It made sense to place a high value on instant gratification.</li>
    <li>Why would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of lung cancer ? Why would someone overeat when they
        know
        it increases their risk of obesity ?</li>
    <li>As a general rule , the more immediate pleasure you get from an action , the more strongly you should question
        whether it aligns with your long - term goals.fn3</li>
    <li>In a perfect world , the reward for a good habit is the habit itself. In the real world , good habits tend to
        feel
        worthwhile only after they have provided you with something. Early on , it’s all sacrifice.</li>
    <li>Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward , which makes it satisfying when you finish. Immediate
        reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealing with habits of avoidance , which are behaviors you want to
        stop
        doing.</li>
    <li>Whenever you pass on a purchase , put the same amount of money in the account. Skip your morning latte ?
        Transfer $
        5. Pass on another month of Netflix ? Move $ 10 over.</li>
    <li>Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.</li>
    <li>Recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next one. Habit tracking naturally builds a
        series of visual cues like the streak of X’s on your calendar or the list of meals in your food log. When you
        look
        at the calendar and see your streak , you’ll be reminded to act again.</li>
    <li>The most effective form of motivation is progress. 6 When we get a signal that we are moving forward , we become
        more motivated to continue</li>
    <li>Tracking can become its own form of reward. It is satisfying to cross an item off your to - do list , to
        complete
        an entry in your workout log , or to mark an X on the calendar.</li>
    <li>First , whenever possible , measurement should be automated. You’ll probably be surprised by how much you’re
        already tracking without knowing it.</li>
    <li>Once you know where to get the data , add a note to your calendar to review it each week or each month , which
        is
        more practical than tracking it every day.</li>
    <li>Second , manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits.</li>
    <li>Finally , record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs.</li>
    <li>I try to remind myself of a simple rule : never miss twice.</li>
    <li>Too often , we fall into an all - or - nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is not slipping up ; the
        problem
        is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly , then you shouldn’t do it at all.</li>
    <li>Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you.</li>
    <li>The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven by the number rather than the purpose
        behind</li>
    <li>This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working long hours instead of getting meaningful work
        done. We care more about getting ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy.</li>
    <li>Charles Goodhart , the principle states , “ When a measure becomes a target , it ceases to be a good measure. ”
    </li>
    <li>Just as governments use laws to hold citizens accountable , you can create a habit contract to hold yourself
        accountable. A habit contract is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a
        particular
        habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through.</li>
    <li>There’s a strong genetic component to how obedient or rebellious you are when facing authority , how vulnerable
        or
        resistant you are to stressful events , how proactive or reactive you tend to be , and even how captivated or
        bored
        you feel during sensory experiences like attending a concert.</li>
    <li>In theory , you can enjoy almost anything. In practice , you are more likely to enjoy the things that come
        easily
        to you.</li>
    <li>the explore / exploit trade - off. 17 In the beginning of a new activity , there should be a period of
        exploration
        . In relationships , it’s called dating.</li>
    <li>The proper balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you are currently winning , you exploit ,
        exploit , exploit. If you are currently losing , you continue to explore , explore , explore.</li>
    <li>As you explore different options , there are a series of questions you can ask yourself to continually narrow in
        on
        the habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you :</li>
    <li>Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the “ accident ” of bad genetics. The more you master a specific
        skill
        , the harder it becomes for others to compete with you.</li>
    <li>Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can’t control whether you’re a potato or an egg , but
        you
        can decide to play a game where it’s better to be hard or soft.</li>
    <li>The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the
        edge
        of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.</li>
    <li>really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still
        find
        a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.</li>
    <li>Perhaps this is why many of the most habit - forming products are those that provide continuous forms of
        novelty.
        Video games provide visual novelty. Porn provides sexual novelty. Junk foods provide culinary novelty. Each of
        these experiences offer continual elements of surprise.</li>
    <li>Variable rewards won’t create a craving — that is , you can’t take a reward people are uninterested in , give it
        to
        them at a variable interval , and hope it will change their mind — but they are a powerful way to amplify the
        cravings we already experience because they reduce boredom.</li>
    <li>This is one of the benefits of following the Goldilocks Rule. If you’re already interested in a habit , working
        on
        challenges of just manageable difficulty is a good way to keep things interesting.</li>
    <li>The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside of habits is that you get used to
        doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors.</li>
    <li>Habits are necessary , but not sufficient for mastery. What you need is a combination of automatic habits and
        deliberate practice.</li>
    <li>Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success , repeating it until you have
        internalized the skill , and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your
        development.</li>
    <li>Improvement is not just about learning habits , it’s also about fine - tuning them. Reflection and review
        ensures
        that you spend your time on the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary</li>
    <li>I employ two primary modes of reflection and review.</li>
    <li>Reflection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily habits are powerful because of how they compound , but
        worrying too much about every daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch away. You can
        see
        every imperfection and lose sight of the bigger picture.</li>
    <li>Periodic reflection and review is like viewing yourself in the mirror from a conversational distance.</li>
    <li>reflection and review offers an ideal time to revisit one of the most important aspects of behavior change :
        identity.</li>
    <li>The more sacred an idea is to us — that is , the more deeply it is tied to our identity — the more strongly we
        will
        defend it against criticism.</li>
    <li>In the words of investor Paul Graham , “ keep your identity small. ” 10 The more you let a single belief define
        you
        , the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you.</li>
    <li>The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourself such that you get to keep important
        aspects
        of your identity even if your particular role changes.</li>
    <li>“ I’m the CEO ” translates to “ I’m the type of person who builds and creates things. ”</li>
    <li>Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state.</li>
    <li>Likewise , suffering is the space between craving a change in state and getting it.</li>
    <li>Peace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into problems.</li>
    <li>If your motivation and desire are great enough ( that is , why you are acting ) , you’ll take action even when it is quite difficult. Great craving can power great action — even when friction is high.</li>
    <li>“ The trick to doing anything is first cultivating a desire for it. ”</li>
    <li>The feeling comes first , and then the behavior.</li>
    <li>Our thoughts and actions are rooted in what we find attractive, not necessarily in what is logical.</li>
    <li>Suffering drives progress.</li>
    <li>The desire to change your state is what powers you to take action.</li>
    <li>Self - control is difficult because it is not satisfying</li>
    <li>Our expectations determine our satisfaction. The gap between our cravings and our rewards determines how satisfied we feel after taking action.</li>'
